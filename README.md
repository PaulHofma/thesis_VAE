# Constructing a Generative Model of Galaxies for the Analysis of Strongly Lensed Systems
## A Master's Thesis by Paul Hofma
Research performed at the University of Amsterdam, at the GRAPPA research institute for the partial fullfilment of the MSc Physics and Astronomy.

All details regarding the research are contained in the file TO_BE_ENTERED.

Dataset used can be found at http://great3.jb.man.ac.uk/leaderboard/data, using the links all the way at the bottom (full training data set).
Preparing the dataset so that it's in a manageable (hdf5) format can be done using the 'Galaxy Data Reader' notebook in the 'data' folder.
All code should then work as expected.

Notebooks should (mostly) speak for themselves, in case you have any questions feel free to contact me through my university mail: paul.hofma@student.uva.nl
